# Security concepts

## Encryption vs Encoding

### Encryption

• Encryption is a process of converting plain text to cipher text which can be decrypted using the key and the algorithm.
<br>
• Purpose: Safety and security of the data.
<br>
• Usage: Protects sensitive data.
<br>
• Part of CIA triad - Confidentiality.
<br>
• Common encryption algorithms: AES, DEA, RSA.

### Encoding

• Conversion of data from one format to another for the ease of transmission and compatibiltity is known as encoding.
<br>
• Purpose: Compatibility and integrity.
<br>
• Data formatting, transmission and storage.
